### Reason Team TODOs

Here's the place to keep up with what's happening for the Reason team! This list isn't exhaustive and might change.

#### Near future

- Validating secret ReasonReact feature, then release it
- Another secret feature
- Syntax change: JavaScript-style function calls [pull request](https://github.com/facebook/reason/pull/1299)
- Testing data structures [immutable.re](https://github.com/facebookincubator/immutable-re)
- Native compilation in bucklescript's `bsb` (see [this fork](https://github.com/bsansouci/bsb-native))
- BuckleScript gets package-based namespacing (no more conflicts with other packages' file names)

#### Future

- Better async story
- Better dev-time printing facility
- Better JSON facilities
- Sleep more

### Your Contribution Opportunities

Wanna help?

- [Better documentation site](https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io/issues)
- Contribute to [your favorite editor plugin for Reason](/guide/editor-tools/editors-plugins#officially-supported-editors)
- On that note: better [ocaml-language-server](https://github.com/freebroccolo/ocaml-language-server). This will potentially power all our editor integration in the future.
- Come up with more [project names starting with "re"](https://github.com/reasonml/ideas-for-project-names-starting-with-re)
- Whatever project you'd normally do in JavaScript, try it in Reason + BuckleScript!
- Talk about Reason and BuckleScript!
- Ping @chenglou in [Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml) for more tasks.
