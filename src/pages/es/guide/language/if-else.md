```reason
if (showMenu) {
  displayMenu ();
};
```

Reason `if`s are expressions; they're evaluated to their body's content:

```reason
let message = if (isMorning) {
  "Good morning!"
} else {
  "Hello!"
};
```

We also have ternary sugar.

```reason
let message = isMorning ? "Good morning!" : "Hello!";
```

### Usage

**`if-else` and ternary are much less used** in Reason than in other languages; [Pattern-matching](/guide/language/pattern-matching) kills a whole category of code that previously required conditionals. Prefer `if-else` if you only have, say, 2 branches.

### Design Decisions

Reason ternary is just a sugar for the `bool` variant and a switch:

```reason
switch isMorning {
| true => "Good morning!"
| false => "Hello!"
}
```

If you pass that through [`refmt`](/guide/editor-tools/extra-goodies#refmt), you'd get:

```reason
isMorning ? "Good morning!" : "Hello!";
```
